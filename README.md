# 2DFiltersFPGA

This repository contains details of a project that uses Nexys 4 Artix 7 FPGA to implement 2D Filtering operation on a greyscale image of size 128x128. The report of the project is also uploaded and code is also shared for learning purpose. For burning the code in the hardware open the project file in ISE as in the following location:

2DFiltersFPGA/Real_time_image_processing/Real_time_image_processing.xise

Each file is added in this folder, if you see anything missing in the project it should be there in the folder.

For test benching, another project can be opened as in the following location:

2DFiltersFPGA/Real_time_image_processing/TestBench_Real_time_image_processing.gise
